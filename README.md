There is a single custom block created to generate a modulation that was not, at the time, 
included with GNU Radio v3.7.12.0 to generate CPFSK. Therefore, to install this, it is necessary
to install GNU Radio, then also install this OOT module. A recipe is included for convenience.
To install, cd into the directory where you have cloned this repository and
    
    $ pybombs -r . install gr-classify
